# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1:  Thursday, May 27, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I did some exercises on FreeCodeCamp (Finished up Basic HTML and HTML5 and started Basic CSS).  I also set up the file structure, repo, and start of a readme for a React App that will be a fun project for my kids and me.

**Thoughts:** FreeCodeCamp: I'm starting at the beginning even though I have already completed the Bootcamp partially as a review.  I am not feeling like it is a waste of time because I'm definitely picking up tidbits that I didn't learn in the class, which can help me in the future.  Setting up React Apps with a server also so that it can talk to the back end gives me a hard time still, but I'm hoping the more I go through it, the easier it will get.

### Day 2: Friday, May 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I did a couple exercises on FreeCodeCamp (CSS).  I practiced some JavaScript Algorithms with a college.  I finished setting up the file structure and router for my family's talent website.  It has the basic pages set up (with nothing on them) and temporary links from the home page to each family member's page and now opens both as a React app from the front end and using the Server.

**Thoughts** I had a weird occurence when running the project app on the server where it would crash once or twice before deploying.  I'll have to check that out at some point to make sure it doesn't mess anything up when going to production.

### Day 3: Saturday, May 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic CSS on FreeCodeCamp; Set up Navbar component and tagged it in each of the four pages on marvelous_manters react project

**Thoughts**: I'm still glad I decided to go through the basic lessons in order because I am picking up some useful tidbits that I hadn't learned before, such as default settings for when fonts or colors aren't available for one reason or another.  Having kind of a low key day today, but I'm glad I was still able to get a component on the page today.

### Day 4: Sunday, May 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 12 Applied Visual Design lessons in FreeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts**: I didn't get as much done today, but at least I'm sticking with it.  I worked for quite a while on my AWS continuation course earlier, which I'm not supposed to count, but it took longer than expected to get some things working. Some of the CSS strategies I'm seeing in FreeCodeCamp today I hadn't used before, so they'll be helpful. Hopefully I'll make a lot of progress on my project tomorrow when I don't have as much going on as I did today.
