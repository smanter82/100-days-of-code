# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1:  Thursday, May 27, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I did some exercises on FreeCodeCamp (Finished up Basic HTML and HTML5 and started Basic CSS.  I also set up a React App for a fun project for my kids and me.

**Thoughts:** FreeCodeCamp: I'm starting at the beginning even though I have already completed the Bootcamp partially as a review.  I am not feeling like it is a waste of time because I'm definitely picking up tidbits that I didn't learn in the class, which can help me in the future.  Setting up React Apps with a server also so that it can talk to the back end gives me a hard time still, but I'm hoping the more I go through it, the easier it will get.
